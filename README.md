# CurrencyConverter

A simple and very basic currency converter project using Python and Tkinter. It is a simple GUI-based application that allows users to convert amounts between different currencies(Currently available are only CAD,USD,INR,EUR,BRL). The application uses the RapidAPI's Currency Converter API by "Not Null" to get the latest currency exchange rates.

To use the application, users simply select the currencies they want to convert between and enter the amount to be converted. The application then displays the converted amount in the other currency. 

The application is easy to use and can be useful for anyone who needs to convert currencies. It is also a good example of how to use Python and Tkinter to build simple GUI applications.

 Supported Currencies : 
- Canadian Dollars 
- United States Dollar 
- Indian Rupees
- Euros
- Brazilian Real
